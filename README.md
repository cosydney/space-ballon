Space-Balloon exerciceðŸŽˆ. 

You can use the template provided or make your own. 

The goal of this exercice is to add Jquery to this ballon so it :

- Expands when you click on it by 20px
- Changes color everytime you click on it
- When it reaches it maximum size (420px) it explodes and goes back to 200px
- When we toggle the balloon (When the mouse hovers it and leaves) it changes color and reduce itself to 5px.
- Colors: Goes from red to green to blue and vice versa when we toggle it.

Optional:
- Have a lunch button so it flyes to outerspace. 

If you finished your Jquery balloon and you've helped your peers making their own you can do the same using only Javascript ðŸ˜‡.
